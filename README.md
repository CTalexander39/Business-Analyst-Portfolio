# Business Analyst Portfolio

My name is Tim Campbell and welcome to my Business Analyst portfolio!

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.

In this portfolio, I have included various artifacts from projects i have worked on this year to research projects conducted during my BSc studies in 2021. 

In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.
